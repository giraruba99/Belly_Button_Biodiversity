# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Purpose of the Analysis
The main purpose of this analysis is to use html, css and JavaScript applications to build a very attractive and interactive data visualization. It is just a beauty when all of them work together, a user-friendly browser which displays belly button microbes that were collected from thousands of volunteers.

## Result and Analysis
* An `index.html` script was written in a way it communicate with `style.css`, `samples.json` and `script.js`.

* A `script.js` scrip was written with a proper functions to create visualization of our `samples.json` data set.

* Our browser displays the drop-down menu to select from those thousands of samples and visualize the data accordingly.

* Our browser was able to display the intended visualizations... except for gauge.

## Issues
* Still working on displaying the gauge displaying on browser
* The browser works on local host but failing on the GitHub pages.
## Summary and conclusion

* Overall, the analysis and visualization went smoothly, with few hick-ups... working on them.
* The power of JavaScript is visible in this project, as it created a means for us to be able to present our overwhelming amount of data in the easiest and user friendly as possible. Any non-data savvy individual would be able to read through this data and make an informed decisions.
